The Redskins opened as 3-point favorites, but the odds have shifted since then with more money being bet on the Vikings.</p>
<p>According to VegasInsider.com, nearly 60 percent of the bets placed so far have been on Minnesota, which has caused the line to move from +3 to -1.5 in favor of the Redskins. That being said, there’s still time for things to change so it’s important to keep an eye on the lines up until kickoff.</p>
<p>So why are the Vikings getting so much love from the books? It could have something to do with their performance against Tampa Bay last week. Minnesota was a slight underdog in that matchup but ended up winning 34-17. The Vikings also looked good in their first two games of the season before losing to the Bills and Rams.</p>
<p>Washington, on the other hand, is coming off a bye week after beating Green Bay 22-9 in Week 3. The Redskins had a close call against Philadelphia in Week 1 and blew out Oakland in Week 2, so they’re definitely not a team to take lightly.</p>
<p>With that being said, here are three reasons why I think Minnesota will cover the spread on Sunday:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Vikings are playing well right now</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Minnesota has looked good in most of their games this season. They already have one win over a team that’s currently above .500 and I think they have a good chance of upsetting Washington as well.</p>
<p>The Redskins have been playing well too, but they haven’t faced any really tough opponents yet. Washington will definitely be tested this week against a hungry Vikings team that’s looking to make a statement.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Kirk Cousins is turnover prone</li>
</ol>
<p>Kirk Cousins is a good quarterback, but he’s also known for making some careless mistakes. In fact, he has the most turnovers of any quarterback in the NFL this season (8). If Minnesota can get pressure on him early and often, they should be able to force some turnovers which could lead to points scored.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Redskins are banged up at receiver<br>The Redskins lost two of their starting receivers last week when Jamison Crowder and Paul Richardson both went down with injuries. Both players are listed as day-to-day leading up to Sunday’s game, but it’s unclear if they will be able to play. If they can’t go, that will leave Washington very thin at receiver and it could lead to some mismatches for the Vikings defense.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Vikings-players-poised-to-earn-big-payouts-from-sports-gambling"><a href="#Minnesota-Vikings-players-poised-to-earn-big-payouts-from-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Vikings players poised to earn big payouts from sports gambling"></a>Minnesota Vikings players poised to earn big payouts from sports gambling</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings are coming off a disappointing season, but they have a number of players who are poised to earn big payouts from sports gambling.</p>
<p>Quarterback Kirk Cousins is the team’s biggest betting asset. He is coming off a season in which he threw for 4,300 yards and 30 touchdowns. Cousins is likely to earn a large payday this offseason, and he is expected to be one of the top players in NFL betting lines.</p>
<p>Other players who could earn big paydays from sports gambling include Stefon Diggs, Adam Thielen and Harrison Smith. Diggs and Thielen are one of the best receiving duos in the NFL, and they should continue to produce big numbers in 2019. Smith is one of the best safeties in the league, and he is expected to anchor the Vikings’ defense this season.</p>
<p>The Vikings may not be contenders this season, but they have a number of players who could make some serious money betting on football games.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-point-spread-is-determined-for-Minnesota-Vikings-games"><a href="#How-the-point-spread-is-determined-for-Minnesota-Vikings-games" class="headerlink" title="How the point spread is determined for Minnesota Vikings games"></a>How the point spread is determined for Minnesota Vikings games</h1><p>The NFL point spread is one of the most popular betting markets in the United States. It is also one of the most commonly misunderstood. In this article, we will explain how the point spread works and provide an example using the Minnesota Vikings game against the Detroit Lions on November 6, 2016.</p>
<p>The point spread is determined by taking into account a variety of factors, including: the teams’ current standings, their past performance, the location of the game, and weather conditions. The goal is to create a line that accurately reflects each team’s chance of winning.</p>
<p>In order to understand how this works in practice, let’s take a look at the Vikings-Lions game from November 6th. The Lions were favored by 3 points in this game. This means that the bookmakers believe that Detroit has a 3-point advantage over Minnesota.</p>
<p>Why would they give Detroit such a big advantage? There are a few reasons: Detroit is currently ranked higher than Minnesota in the standings, Detroit has a better record than Minnesota this season, and the game is being played in Detroit. Additionally, there are concerns about whether or not Adrian Peterson (the Vikings’ running back) will be able to play due to an injury. All of these factors contribute to Detroit’s edge in this particular game.</p>
<p>If you wanted to bet on Minnesota in this game, you would need to risk $3 for every $1 you hope to win. So if you put down $100 on Minnesota, and they won the game outright or covered the point spread, you would win $333 (your original investment plus your winnings). If you wanted to bet on Detroit instead, you would need to risk only $87 to win the same amount (again, assuming they cover the spread).</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that bookmakers aren’t always right - sometimes they make mistakes! That’s why it’s important to do your own research before placing any bets.</p>
<h1 id="Sportsbooks-taking-bets-on-Minnesota-Vikings-games"><a href="#Sportsbooks-taking-bets-on-Minnesota-Vikings-games" class="headerlink" title="Sportsbooks taking bets on Minnesota Vikings games"></a>Sportsbooks taking bets on Minnesota Vikings games</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have been one of the most exciting teams in the NFL this season, thanks to their dominant defense and young quarterback. As a result, many sportsbooks are now taking bets on Vikings games.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about betting on the Minnesota Vikings, it’s important to understand the odds that are available. The most common types of bets are moneyline bets, where you bet on who will win the game, and point spread bets, where you bet on how many points one team will win or lose by.</p>
<p>The Vikings are currently 3-point favorites against the Dallas Cowboys this weekend. If you think Minnesota is going to win by more than 3 points, then you would want to place a moneyline bet on them. However, if you think Dallas will beat Minnesota, then you would want to place a moneyline bet on the Cowboys.</p>
<p>There are also other types of bets that can be placed on NFL games, such as over/under bets and prop bets. Over/under bets are wagers on how many total points will be scored in a game, while prop bets are wagers on specific events that might happen during a game (e.g., which player will score the first touchdown).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in betting on the Vikings this weekend, be sure to check out the odds at your favorite sportsbook. It’s important to do your research and understand the different types of bets that are available before placing any wagers.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-considering-allowing-Las-Vegas-to-take-bets-on-Minnesota-Vikings-games"><a href="#NFL-considering-allowing-Las-Vegas-to-take-bets-on-Minnesota-Vikings-games" class="headerlink" title="NFL considering allowing Las Vegas to take bets on Minnesota Vikings games"></a>NFL considering allowing Las Vegas to take bets on Minnesota Vikings games</h1><p>The NFL could soon allow Las Vegas sportsbooks to take bets on Minnesota Vikings games, according to a report from ESPN.</p>
<p>The league is considering a proposal that would allow the state of Nevada to take bets on all NFL games, not just those involving the Vegas team. If the proposal is approved, it would mark the first time in US history that sports betting would be legal outside of a state’s borders.</p>
<p>Nevada is currently the only state where single-game sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>The Vikings are coming off of a disappointing season in which they finished 8-7-1 and missed the playoffs. The team has made the playoffs just once in the last six seasons and has not won a playoff game since 2009.</p>
<p>Some believe that legalizing betting on Vikings games could help motivate the team to improve their performance.<br>“I think it would be great for the Vikings,” said Minneapolis resident Ben Johnson. “It would add some excitement to the games and maybe give them an extra incentive to win.”</p>
<p>Others are not so sure that gambling on NFL games will have any positive effect on teams’ performances.<br>“I’m not sure how much difference it would make,” said St. Paul resident Tony Kvande. “Most of the time, people are just betting on who is going to win, not on specific players or matchups.”</p>
<p>Whether or not the proposal is approved, it appears that gambling on NFL games is here to stay. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of illegal gambling on NFL games, both in person and online. It is likely that if Nevada is given the green light to take bets on all NFL games, other states will soon follow suit.</p>
