        <h1 id="Soboba-Casino-Could-be-Coming-to-Louisiana"><a href="#Soboba-Casino-Could-be-Coming-to-Louisiana" class="headerlink" title="Soboba Casino Could be Coming to Louisiana!"></a>Soboba Casino Could be Coming to Louisiana!</h1><p>According to recent reports, the Soboba Casino Corporation is interested in building a new casino in Louisiana. The company has apparently been in talks with state officials about the possibility of building a facility in either New Orleans or Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>This would be big news for Louisiana, which currently does not have any casinos located within its borders. If the Soboba Casino Corporation goes through with its plans, it would be the first Native American-owned casino to open in the state.</p>
<p>There has been no official announcement from the Soboba Casino Corporation yet, so it’s still unclear exactly what their plans are. However, if they do decide to build a casino in Louisiana, it could be a major boon for the local economy.</p>
<p>Not only would the casino create jobs and bring in tourism dollars, but it would also generate much-needed revenue for the state government. Louisiana is currently facing a budget crisis, so any additional sources of income would be welcome news.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to know whether or not this will actually happen, but we will keep you updated as details become available. In the meantime, let us know what you think about the potential arrival of Soboba Casino Corporation in Louisiana!</p>
<h1 id="Soboba-Casino-Files-for-Licensing-in-Louisiana"><a href="#Soboba-Casino-Files-for-Licensing-in-Louisiana" class="headerlink" title="Soboba Casino Files for Licensing in Louisiana"></a>Soboba Casino Files for Licensing in Louisiana</h1><p>Casino operator Soboba Casino has submitted an application to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (LGCB) for a gaming license. If approved, the casino would be allowed to offer slots and table games at its proposed site in Lake Charles.</p>
<p>The company is seeking to build a $135 million facility that would create 350 jobs. It would be Soboba’s first casino outside of California.</p>
<p>Soboba CEO Mark Macarro said, “We are excited about our proposed project in Lake Charles and the potential positive economic impact it could have on the region. We look forward to working with the LGCB as they conduct their review of our license application.”</p>
<p>The LGCB will review Soboba’s application and hold a public hearing before making a decision on the license.</p>
<h1 id="Soboba-Looks-to-Expand-Gambling-Operations-into-Louisiana"><a href="#Soboba-Looks-to-Expand-Gambling-Operations-into-Louisiana" class="headerlink" title="Soboba Looks to Expand Gambling Operations into Louisiana"></a>Soboba Looks to Expand Gambling Operations into Louisiana</h1><p>In March of 2017, the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians announced plans to expand its gambling operations into Louisiana. The tribe has long operated a casino in southern California, but is now eyeing the potential for growth in the Bayou State.</p>
<p>The proposed project would see a new Soboba Casino constructed in Bossier City, just outside of Shreveport. If approved, the casino could be open as soon as 2020.</p>
<p>Officials with the tribe say that the new casino would create hundreds of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue for Louisiana. They also maintain that it would be a boon for local businesses and tourism.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced, however. Some opponents argue that the new casino would cannibalize business from other gambling establishments in the area and that it would be a negative for the community overall.</p>
<p>The proposal is currently being considered by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. A vote is expected later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Plans-for-a-Soboba-Casino-in-Louisiana-Moving-Ahead"><a href="#Plans-for-a-Soboba-Casino-in-Louisiana-Moving-Ahead" class="headerlink" title="Plans for a Soboba Casino in Louisiana Moving Ahead"></a>Plans for a Soboba Casino in Louisiana Moving Ahead</h1><p>The Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians is moving ahead with plans for a casino in Louisiana. The proposed casino would be located in St. Tammany Parish, about 25 miles north of New Orleans. The tribe has purchased a site for the casino and is now in the process of securing permits from the state.</p>
<p>If the tribe is successful in getting the necessary permits, construction of the casino could begin as early as this fall. The tribe plans to open the casino in late 2020 or early 2021.</p>
<p>The Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians already operates two casinos near San Jacinto, California. The new casino in Louisiana would be their third. The tribe says that their casinos are successful and that they are looking to expand into other markets.</p>
<p>Opposition to the casino is already mounting, however. Local residents and business owners are concerned that the casino will have a negative impact on their community. They argue that it will lead to increased crime and traffic congestion and that it will take business away from local businesses.</p>
<p>The tribe contends that their casinos are good for the local economy and create jobs. They say that they have worked closely with local officials to ensure that the proposed casino will be a positive addition to the community.</p>
<p>Who is right? Only time will tell. In the meantime, both sides will continue to make their case to the public.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Officials-Approve-Soboba-Casino"><a href="#Louisiana-Officials-Approve-Soboba-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Officials Approve Soboba Casino"></a>Louisiana Officials Approve Soboba Casino</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board unanimously voted to approve the Soboba Casino Resort in San Jacinto County. The tribe plans to build a $245 million casino resort on their reservation that will include a hotel, spa, and conference center.</p>
<p>“The Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians is excited to have the unanimous approval from the Louisiana Gaming Control Board for our proposed Soboba Casino Resort,” said tribal chairman Richard Milanovich. “We would like to thank the commissioners for their time and consideration and we look forward to working with them as we move forward with this project.”</p>
<p>The tribe is still awaiting environmental clearance from the Army Corps of Engineers, but they are expecting construction to begin in early 2019. The casino is expected to create 1,200 jobs and generate more than $100 million annually for the local economy.</p>
