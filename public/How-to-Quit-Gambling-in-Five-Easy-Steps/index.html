<li>Understand why you gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in quitting gambling is understanding why you do it in the first place. Do you gamble to escape from problems or stress? To make money? To have fun? Once you understand your motivations for gambling, it will be easier to tackle quitting.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Avoid triggers that lead to gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you know certain things trigger your urge to gamble, try to avoid them. This could mean staying away from casinos, blackjack tables or online betting websites. If you can’t avoid the temptation altogether, try to delay yourself as long as possible before giving in.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set rules for yourself and stick to them</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to help resist the temptation to gamble is by setting rules for yourself and sticking to them rigidly. This could mean only gambling a certain amount of money each week, or only betting on games you are confident you can win. Having these restrictions in place will help stop you from overspending or losing more money than you intended.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Find healthy distractions</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling, try to find some healthy distractions instead. This could be anything from reading a book, going for a run or spending time with friends and family. By filling your spare time with positive activities, it will be easier not to think about gambling as an escape.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Seek help and support if needed</li>
</ol>
<p>Quitting gambling can be difficult, especially if you’ve been doing it for a long time. If you feel like you’re struggling, seek help and support from a friend or professional counsellor. There is no shame in admitting that you need assistance – in fact, it shows that you’re taking proactive steps towards improving your wellbeing</p>
