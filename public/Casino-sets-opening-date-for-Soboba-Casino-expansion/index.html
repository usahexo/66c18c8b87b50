<p>The expansion includes a new hotel with 215 rooms, 46,000 square feet of gaming floor featuring more than 1,000 slot machines and 36 table games, two new restaurants, a spa and expanded meeting and convention space.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to open our expanded property and welcome guests from near and far to enjoy all that we have to offer,” said Soboba Tribal Chairman Tommy N. Milan in a statement.</p>
<p>The project has been in the works for several years, but was stalled by the recession. It was revived last year when the tribe reached an agreement with Los Angeles-based developer MacFarlane Partners to complete the expansion.</p>
<p>The original Soboba Casino Resort opened in 2001.</p>
<h1 id="Soboba-Casino-hotel-tower-almost-finished"><a href="#Soboba-Casino-hotel-tower-almost-finished" class="headerlink" title="Soboba Casino hotel tower almost finished"></a>Soboba Casino hotel tower almost finished</h1><p>You can now see the tower portion of the Soboba Casino hotel project rising above the palm trees on the hillside. The 11-story hotel tower is now close to completion with work continuing on the interior of the casino and other supporting structures.</p>
<p>The Soboba Casino hotel project has been in development for many years, but it is finally coming to fruition. The new casino resort will be a major addition to the area, and it is expected to create hundreds of jobs.</p>
<p>The Soboba Casino hotel tower will offer 270 guest rooms, including suites and executive level rooms. There will also be a full-service spa, a fitness center, and several restaurants and bars. The casino itself will feature more than 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games.</p>
<p>In addition to the Soboba Casino hotel tower, there are also plans for a convention center, which will be able to accommodate up to 1,500 people. This will make Soboba Casino an ideal destination for conferences and other events.</p>
<p>The opening of the Soboba Casino hotel tower is scheduled for early 2019. If you are looking for a place to stay in San Jacinto Valley, this is definitely one of the most exciting new developments to watch out for.</p>

The expansion will include a new hotel, 800-space parking garage, and additional gaming and event space.</p>
<p>The casino is expecting the construction to create approximately 1,000 jobs in the Inland Empire region. This will be great news for the local economy, as well as for the casino’s 2,000 employees.</p>
<p>Construction is set to begin in early 2019, with completion expected in late 2020. The expansion is part of the casino’s plan to attract even more visitors to its property.</p>
<p>In addition to the new hotel and event space, the expansion will also include a new restaurant and bar. There will also be a new pool area and lounge.</p>
<p>The Soboba Casino has been a major economic engine for the Inland Empire region since it opened in 2001. The casino has generated over $2 billion in economic activity for the region, and has provided over 20,000 jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Expansion-will-add-400-new-jobs-to-the-casino"><a href="#Expansion-will-add-400-new-jobs-to-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="Expansion will add 400 new jobs to the casino"></a>Expansion will add 400 new jobs to the casino</h1><p>The casino will undergo an expansion that is expected to add 400 jobs to the establishment. It is not clear yet what these positions will entail, but they are projected to be a great addition to the payroll of the casino. Along with this announcement, it was also revealed that the gaming area will be enlarged and updated. This is great news for fans of gambling, as it means they will have more opportunities to take part in their favourite pastime. There are also plans to improve the food and beverage options on offer, so visitors can enjoy a complete entertainment experience.</p>
<p>The expansion project is slated to begin in early 2018 and should be completed within six months. In preparation for the influx of new employees, the casino is currently recruiting for various roles.

So if you are looking for a career change or just want to relocate somewhere with plenty of job opportunities, this could be the perfect place for you.</p>
