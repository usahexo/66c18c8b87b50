This issue is especially normal among players who access online clubhouse from their home PCs and cell phones. Albeit a few nations have set up measures to forestall people from betting too much, these arrangements have not been altogether effective in keeping away from this issue. The accompanying article will give a review of the exploration on how to forestall individuals from betting excessively at online club and additionally propose viable arrangements that can be actualized to address this issue.</p>
<p>The utilization of internet betting locales has turned into a standout amongst the most well-known methods for spending free time. A recent report discharged by Statista showed that in 2018, around 21% of people aged 16-74 had played some type of computer game in the month preceding the survey. Among these gamers, 11% had wagered cash on games of chance, which included both land-based and online casinos (Statista, 2019). Worryingly, this number has been developing consistently as more individuals are getting admission to the internet and turning into players at online casinos.</p>
<p>While playing casino games at online clubs can be a rewarding background, there is always a danger of falling into addictive betting practices that can prompt genuine money related and mental issues. In spite of measures put in place by governments to keep people from betting excessively at online casinos, these strategies have not been altogether successful in averting this issue. So as to comprehend why these measures haven’t been completely powerful and what can be done to acquire better outcomes, it is important to first take a gander at what comprises problem gambling behavior. </p>
<p>In 2002, Dr. Tony Toneatto distributed an article which characterized pathological gambling as “a sickness characterized by tremendous expert over wagering, continuation notwithstanding negative results, lying to cover up the seriousness of the issue, and misery or disgrace because of losing cash” (Toneatto, 2002). In different investigations since then, this definition has remained steady with just minor changes made to reflect how people gamble today utilizing new innovation like cell phones and PCs. From this definition we can see that individuals who have pathological gambling habits will exhibit signs of compulsion and will have little mastery over their betting practices. Furthermore they will usually experience negative consequences such as monetary losses however still continue gambling regardless. Lastly, these individuals may feel shameful or depressed about their gambling behavior but will often hide it from friends and family members. </p>
<p>Given this understanding of problem gambling behavior, what can be done to prevent people from engaging in such activities? There are many potential solutions that could be implemented; however it is important first to consider what barriers might prevent these solutions from being successful. Some possible barriers include: lack of public awareness about problem gambling; lack of funds available for prevention programs; reluctance on behalf of governments to address the issue due to moral considerations; difficulty measuring success rates of prevention programs; and cultural attitudes that glorify gambling (Driscoll et al., 2016). With that being said here are five potential solutions that could be implemented in order to help prevent people from excessive gambling at online casinos:</p>
<ol>
<li>Awareness campaigns - One way to help prevent problem gambling is through public awareness campaigns which aim to educate people about the dangers associated with excessive casino gaming. Such campaigns could be targeted towards general population as well as groups known to be at high risk for developing problem gambling behaviors such as young adults or those living in low socio-economic areas. Additionally, campaigns could also target specific drugs which are known to interact with casino games e.g stimulants like caffeine or nicotine which can increase impulsiveness and lead to increased gaming losses (Maloney et al., 2017). By increasing awareness about problem gambling behaviors among the general population as well as high risk groups, we can help create a society where excessive casino gaming is seen as less socially acceptable thus reducing the likelihood someone will engage in such activities.</li>
<li>Provision of support services - Another way to help prevent problem gambling is through provision of support services such as counselling or rehabilitation programs for those who are already addicted To gamble excessively at an online casino.. Support services are essential for helping individuals recover from pathological gambling habits while also providing them with resources needed stop future relapses. However provision of support services is often costly and time consuming making it difficult for government agencies to provide them on a large scale . In light this challenge,, one possible solution would be for private companies or charities sector step in fill some gaps support service provision (Driscoll et al., 2016). </li>
<li>Regulations on advertising - Along with public awareness campaigns,, effective regulations on advertising could play an important role preventing people gaming excessively an online casino setting forth certain rules Casino operators must abide by when marketing their products . For example,, advertisements for casinos could not target minors or include images or messages which promote excessive playing . In addition,, regulators could require operators disclose information about odds associated with different games so players aware how likely</li>

Some people create rules for themselves, such as only gambling a certain amount of money or only gambling on certain days of the week. Others try to stay away from any kind of gambling temptation by staying away from online casinos altogether or by only playing games that they know they cannot lose money on, such as poker or blackjack.</p>
<p>No matter how you choose to keep from gambling at online casinos, it is important to have a plan and to stick to it.

<p>If you find that you are struggling to stick to your own rules, there are also some helpful tools that you can use to help keep yourself accountable. One such tool is called a “gambling tracker”.

If you find yourself struggling, remind yourself why gambling is not good for you and what problems it has caused in the past. This can help put things into perspective and give you the strength neededto resist temptation.</p>
