        <h1 id="Rudy’s-Revenge-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Looks-to-Avenge-Last-Season’s-Playoff-Loss-to-Barcelona"><a href="#Rudy’s-Revenge-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Looks-to-Avenge-Last-Season’s-Playoff-Loss-to-Barcelona" class="headerlink" title="Rudy’s Revenge: Maccabi Tel Aviv Looks to Avenge Last Season’s Playoff Loss to Barcelona"></a>Rudy’s Revenge: Maccabi Tel Aviv Looks to Avenge Last Season’s Playoff Loss to Barcelona</h1><p>It has been 5 months since Maccabi Tel Aviv lost to Barcelona in heartbreaking fashion, Rudy’s Revenge. That game was a microcosm of Maccabi’s season; they were the better team for most of the game, but couldn’t close it out when it mattered most. This season, Maccabi looks to avenge that loss and make it to their first ever Euroleague Final.</p>
<p>Maccabi is led by American forward Tyrese Rice and Israeli guard Gal Mekel. Rice is coming off a great season in which he was named Israeli League MVP. Mekel had a breakout season last year and was one of the league’s top distributors. Other key players include center Sofoklis Schortsanitis, who is known as “The Greek Freak”, and swingman Ricky Hickman.</p>
<p>Maccabi has had an up-and-down season so far, but they are peaking at the right time. In their last 8 games, they have only lost once, and they have looked very impressive in their last few outings. They will need to continue this play in order to make it past Barcelona.</p>
<p>Barcelona is a very good team, but they are not unbeatable. They are led by Argentine forward Juan Carlos Navarro and Spanish center Marc Gasol. Navarro is one of the best players inEuropeand Gasol is one of the best young big men in the world. Other key players for Barcelona include point guard Sergio Rodriguez and shooting guard Alex Abrines.</p>
<p>Barcelona has had an excellent season thus far, but they have not been quite as dominant as Maccabi has been lately. They will need to be at their best in order to advance past Maccabi.</p>
<p>This matchup should be very exciting and closely contested. It should come down to who makes the most timely plays down the stretch. I believe that Maccabi will come out on top and advance to their first ever Euroleague Final.</p>
<h1 id="EuroLeague-Playoff-Preview-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-vs-FC-Barcelona"><a href="#EuroLeague-Playoff-Preview-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-vs-FC-Barcelona" class="headerlink" title="EuroLeague Playoff Preview: Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. FC Barcelona"></a>EuroLeague Playoff Preview: Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. FC Barcelona</h1><p>The Euroleague playoffs are set to start on Thursday, when Maccabi Tel Aviv takes on FC Barcelona in the first semifinal. Here is a preview of that matchup:</p>
<p>Maccabi Tel Aviv enters the playoffs as the No. 2 seed, while Barcelona is the No. 3 seed.</p>
<p>It will be the third consecutive year that these two teams meet in the playoffs. Maccabi won both meetings last season, but Barcelona beat Maccabi in their only meeting during the regular season this year.</p>
<p>Maccabi is led by American guard Jeremy Pargo, who averaged 18.8 points per game during the regular season. Forward Sofoklis Schortsanitis (“The Greek Freak”) and center Nikola Vujcic are also key players for Maccabi.</p>
<p>Barcelona is led by Spanish guard Juan Carlos Navarro, who averaged 17.8 points per game during the regular season. Forward Fran Vasquez and center Marc Gasol are also important players for Barcelona.</p>
<p>This should be a close series, but I give a slight edge to Maccabi Tel Aviv because of their experience in these types of matchups.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Will-Win-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-vs-FC-Barcelona-Point-Spread-Analysis"><a href="#Who-Will-Win-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-vs-FC-Barcelona-Point-Spread-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Win Maccabi Tel Aviv vs FC Barcelona? Point Spread Analysis"></a>Who Will Win Maccabi Tel Aviv vs FC Barcelona? Point Spread Analysis</h1><p>The matchup between Maccabi Tel Aviv and FC Barcelona is definitely one to watch. Both clubs are filled with some of the world’s most talented players, so it’s anyone’s guess as to who will come out on top.</p>
<p>Maccabi Tel Aviv comes into this match as the underdog. They’re currently ranked 6th in the EuroLeague, while FC Barcelona is ranked 2nd. However, that doesn’t mean they can’t pull off an upset.</p>
<p>One thing working in Maccabi Tel Aviv’s favor is their home court advantage. They’ve been undefeated at home this season, so they’ll be looking to keep that streak alive against FC Barcelona.</p>
<p>FC Barcelona is a strong team, but they’ll definitely have their work cut out for them against Maccabi Tel Aviv. If Maccabi Tel Aviv can use their home court advantage to their advantage, then they have a good chance of upsetting FC Barcelona.</p>
<h1 id="Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Looks-to-Extend-Point-Spread-Dominance-in-EuroLeague-Playoffs"><a href="#Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Looks-to-Extend-Point-Spread-Dominance-in-EuroLeague-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Maccabi Tel Aviv Looks to Extend Point Spread Dominance in EuroLeague Playoffs"></a>Maccabi Tel Aviv Looks to Extend Point Spread Dominance in EuroLeague Playoffs</h1><p>Maccabi Tel Aviv is one of the most successful clubs in European basketball history. They have won a total of 33 European titles, including 18 EuroLeague Championships. This year’s team is looking to add to that legacy, and they currently hold a 3-point lead over their opponents in the EuroLeague Playoffs.</p>
<p>Led by captain Mickey Tablet and veteran scorer Devin Smith, Maccabi Tel Aviv is playing some of their best basketball right now. They dominated Anadolu Efes in the first round of the playoffs, winning four out of five games by an average margin of 16 points.</p>
<p>Now they face powerhouse Real Madrid in the semifinals. This will be a much tougher matchup for Maccabi Tel Aviv, but they are still favored to win. Real Madrid has had a disappointing season by their standards, and they will be without superstar Luka Doncic for this series.</p>
<p>Maccabi Tel Aviv has been led by their defense all season long. They are 1st in the Euroleague in Defensive Rating and 2nd in Points Allowed Per Game. Their imposing frontline of Tablet, Smith, Yaniv Green, and Jake Cohen has been difficult for opponents to score against.</p>
<p>If Maccabi Tel Aviv can continue to play lockdown defense and get contributions from their supporting cast, they should be able to extend their point spread dominance and win their 19th EuroLeague Championship.</p>
<h1 id="Point-Spreads-Favor-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-in-EuroLeague-Playoff-Matchups"><a href="#Point-Spreads-Favor-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-in-EuroLeague-Playoff-Matchups" class="headerlink" title="Point Spreads Favor Maccabi Tel Aviv in EuroLeague Playoff Matchups"></a>Point Spreads Favor Maccabi Tel Aviv in EuroLeague Playoff Matchups</h1><p>Intel Extreme Masters Oakland is coming up, with a ton of top-tier League of Legends teams competing. As the playoffs approach, some matchups are already set in stone. And in the EuroLeague, one team is favored over the rest.</p>
<p>Maccabi Tel Aviv is a Israeli professional basketball club based in Tel Aviv. The team has had a lot of success in European competitions, including winning the EuroLeague championship in 2004. This season, they topped their group in the EuroLeague and now have home court advantage in their playoff matchup against Darussafaka Dogus Istanbul.</p>
<p>The odds for this matchup have Maccabi as -280 favorites. Darussafaka Dogus Istanbul is at +220 to win the series. These point spreads suggest that Maccabi is a heavy favorite and should advance to the next round with relative ease.</p>
<p>Of course, anything can happen in a best-of-seven series. But if these odds hold true, it would be a major upset if that Turkish club were to pull off the victory.</p>
