#  How to Use Pts Sports Betting Betzest?

Betting on sports is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the world. Millions of people put money down on games each year, in the hope of winning big payouts.

There are a number of different ways to bet on sports, but one of the most popular is through so-called “point spreads”. In this type of wager, you are not betting on who will win or lose the game outright, but rather how much they will win or lose by.

For example, let’s say you think that the Houston Rockets will beat the Golden State Warriors by 5 points. You could place a point spread bet on this game, and if you are correct, you will win your bet even if the Warriors end up winning the game.

However, while point spread bets can be very lucrative, they can also be somewhat tricky to understand. In this article, we are going to take a look at how to use pts sports betting Betzest for this type of wager.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that point spread bets always involve two teams – “the favorite” and “the underdog”. The favorite is the team that is expected to win the game by the bookies, while the underdog is the team that is expected to lose (or at least not win) by them.

The point spread is simply a measure of how many points the favorite is expected to win by. So in our example above, if the Rockets were favored by 5 points, then that would mean that they were expected to beat the Warriors by 6 points or more. If they only won by 5 points or less, then anyone who had placed a point spread bet on them would have lost their money.

Now that we know what a point spread bet is, let’s take a look at how to place one using Betzest. Firstly, head over to their website and create an account if you don’t already have one. Once you have done that, click on “Sports” in the top menu bar and then select “Point Spreads” from the sub-menu:

From here, you will be taken to a page where you can see all of Betzest’s current point spread bets:
