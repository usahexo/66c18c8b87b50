#  PokerStars and 22Bet announce partnership

PokerStars and 22Bet have announced a partnership which will see the two companies work together to promote each other’s brands.

22Bet is a leading online bookmaker that offers players a wide range of betting options, including poker, casino games, sports betting, and eSports. The company is licensed in Curaçao and Malta and offers its services to customers in over 20 languages.

PokerStars is the world’s largest online poker site, with over 100 million registered players. The company is licensed in the Isle of Man and offers its services to customers in over 200 countries.

Under the terms of the agreement, PokerStars will be the exclusive provider of online poker liquidity for 22Bet. In addition, 22Bet will become the official sponsor of PokerStars’ flagship tournaments, including the European Poker Tour (EPT) and the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA).

The partnership comes at a time when both companies are looking to expand their operations into new markets. 22Bet is planning to launch its first regulated poker room in Italy later this year, while PokerStars is gearing up for the launch of its new Brazilian site in 2019.

In a statement, Eric Hollreiser, Vice President of Corporate Communications at PokerStars, said: “This partnership with 22Bet allows us to further our expansion into new markets by leveraging their impressive infrastructure and scale. We look forward to working with them as we continue to grow our business globally.”

Ananth Ganesan, CEO of 22Bet, added: “Poker is one of the most popular games on our platform and we are excited to partner with PokerStars – one of the biggest names in the industry. This partnership will help us grow our business globally and provide our players with an even better experience.”

22Bet is to offer its poker players the opportunity to play against PokerStars pros. The move will see the Russian-owned and -licensed online gaming company become the first in the industry to provide this type of service. Players can already start qualifying for the sit-and-go tournaments, which will take place on 22Bet’s Twitch channel, with the first scheduled for April 1st.

The decision to work with PokerStars comes as 22Bet ramps up its live offering. Earlier this year, the company announced it had secured a partnership agreement with Dusk Till Dawn (DTD)Casino that will see it become the exclusive online poker partner of both DTD and Grosvenor Casino. This builds on an existing deal between 22Bet and Extreme Live Gaming, which has seen the two companies team up to offer a number of exclusive live tournaments.

Commenting on the new arrangement, 22Bet’s Head of Poker Alex Igelman said; “We are really excited about this collaboration with PokerStars. It is a great opportunity for our players to test their skills against some of the best in the business. We are sure that they will relish the chance to take on some of Team Pro members such as Daniel Negreanu and Jason Mercier.”

PokerStars’ Director of Poker Rooms Neil Gibson added: “22Bet is a growing force in European poker and we are very happy to be working with them. This is a great opportunity for our players to experience some live action at one of Europe’s premier venues, as well as win some prizes from 22Bet’s generous prize pool.”
