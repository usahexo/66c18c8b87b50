#  Who are the Celtics?

The Boston Celtics are a professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the original eight NBA teams, the Celtics are one of the most successful franchises in the history of American professional sports.[4]

Their 17 NBA Championships are the most for any NBA franchise. They have also won 21 American Basketball Association (ABA) championships, making them the most successful ABA team. The Celtics have played their home games at TD Garden since 1994. The team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC.

The Celtics were formed in 1946 by Walter Brown as one of the original eight teams in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the National Basketball Association after merging with the National Basketball League in 1949. In 1950, they reached their first NBA Finals and lost to the Minneapolis Lakers 4-3.[5] They would reach this same level again in 1953, but would fall short once again against the Lakers. One of Celtics' most legendary players, Bill Russell, led his team to consecutive championships in 1959 and 1960; however, during that time period no other team managed to win an NBA championship series against Los Angeles.

Boston's streak was broken when Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia Warriors came from 3-1 down to defeat them 4-3 in 1962.[6] Russell took over coaching duties for 1963–64 and led them to their sixth championship. However, Russell retired after that season and was replaced by K. C. Jones who led them to two more championships in 1974 and 1976. Following Larry Bird's entry into the league as a rookie player for 1979–80 season and eventual retirement as a player in 1992, Red Auerbach retired as coach shortly afterwards; he was replaced by M. L. Carr who lasted only two seasons before being replaced by Rick Pitino. After Pitino's resignation midway through 1997–98 season, General Manager Danny Ainge took over on an interim basis before being promoted permanently after buying out his contract from Kentucky Wildcats.[7]

The Celtics made a remarkable run back to contention in 2007–08 after slipping into irrelevance with back-to-back lottery appearances in 2005 and 2006,[8] becoming Eastern Conference Champions and reaching 2008 NBA Finals where they eventually lost to Kobe Bryant and his Los Angeles Lakers teammates.[9] Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen,[10][11][12][13] they returned to the Finals for a rematch with L.A., this time emerging victorious 4-2 with Rajon Rondo named MVP of Finals; it was their first title since 1986.[14] Having suffered season-ending injuries to both Rondo (thumb) and Garnett (knee) early on during 2013–14 campaign,[15][16][17][18] rookie head coach Brad Stevens led a depleted young squad that restarted its rebuilding process towards future championship contention.[19][20][21][22] After four years of rebuilding through draft picks and trades,[23][24] Kyrie Irving was added via trade from Cleveland Cavaliers midway through 2017-18 season,[25]; leading Irving & Hayward to come back & play together once again giving Boston new hope for another championship push while gathering more young talent (Jayson Tatum & Jaylen Brown) thru drafts . 

On September 26th 2018 Aron Baynes opted out from his contract making him an unrestricted free agent 
making roster spots available forMarcus Morris(signed)&Terry Rozier III(resigned).
