#  Casino sets opening date for Soboba Casino expansion

The Soboba Casino Resort has set a tentative opening date of Dec. 10 for its $265 million expansion that will nearly double the size of the tribal casino.

The expansion includes a new hotel with 215 rooms, 46,000 square feet of gaming floor featuring more than 1,000 slot machines and 36 table games, two new restaurants, a spa and expanded meeting and convention space.

“We are very excited to open our expanded property and welcome guests from near and far to enjoy all that we have to offer,” said Soboba Tribal Chairman Tommy N. Milan in a statement.

The project has been in the works for several years, but was stalled by the recession. It was revived last year when the tribe reached an agreement with Los Angeles-based developer MacFarlane Partners to complete the expansion.

The original Soboba Casino Resort opened in 2001.

You can now see the tower portion of the Soboba Casino hotel project rising above the palm trees on the hillside. The 11-story hotel tower is now close to completion with work continuing on the interior of the casino and other supporting structures.

The Soboba Casino hotel project has been in development for many years, but it is finally coming to fruition. The new casino resort will be a major addition to the area, and it is expected to create hundreds of jobs.

The Soboba Casino hotel tower will offer 270 guest rooms, including suites and executive level rooms. There will also be a full-service spa, a fitness center, and several restaurants and bars. The casino itself will feature more than 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games.

In addition to the Soboba Casino hotel tower, there are also plans for a convention center, which will be able to accommodate up to 1,500 people. This will make Soboba Casino an ideal destination for conferences and other events.

The opening of the Soboba Casino hotel tower is scheduled for early 2019. If you are looking for a place to stay in San Jacinto Valley, this is definitely one of the most exciting new developments to watch out for.
