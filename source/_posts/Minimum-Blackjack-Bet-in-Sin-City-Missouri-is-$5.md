#  Minimum Blackjack Bet in Sin City Missouri is $5

Missouri has always been a low minimum gambling state, and that includes blackjack. Although the minimum bet at blackjack tables in Missouri is $5, most casinos in Sin City will let you play for as low as $1.

There are some notable exceptions: Ameristar Casino in Kansas City has a minimum bet of $10, and Argosy Casino in Riverside charges $15. But for the most part, if you're looking to save money and betting less than $10 per hand isn't a deal-breaker, then Missouri is the place to be.

Just be sure to check out the table minimums before you sit down, as they can vary from casino to casino.

Money is not the only thing exchanging hands at blackjack tables in Sin City Missouri – it’s also entertainment. The minimum bet in most casinos is $10, but this varies by casino. For those who want to enjoy a night of gambling without breaking the bank, some casinos offer $5 blackjack tables, though the odds are not as good as at the $10 tables.

The Players Club at Hollywood Casino in Maryland Heights offers blackjack starting at $5 and goes up to $200. At Ameristar Casino East Chicago, there are three blackjack tables with minimum bets of $10, but also a “$2 fire bet” that pays off at 2-1 if the player gets a blackjack. With this wager, players can enjoy all the action of blackjack for just $4.

#  Minimum Blackjack Bet in Sin City Missouri is $1,000

There’s a new minimum in Sin City. The Missouri Gaming Commission has approved a new rule requiring Blackjack tables to have a $1,000 minimum bet.

The state gaming commission unanimously voted in favor of the measure, which will go into effect Jan. 1, 2019. MGM Springfield, which is set to open in September, will be the first casino in the state to offer the high roller tables.

The new regulation is designed to attract high-end players and help boost revenue at casinos in the state. It was opposed by some casino operators who say it will drive away players who would rather gamble at lower minimums.

But supporters of the move say it will help casinos compete with neighboring states that already have $5 and $10 minimums. They also note that there are already plenty of low minimum tables available for those players who want them.
