#  First Game of Privilege Bingo in Guyana!

This past weekend, a new game hit the town of Georgetown, Guyana - Privilege Bingo! The first game was organized by local entrepreneurs, Terrence and AstridYearwood, and it was a smashing success.

The concept of the game is simple. There are five different types of privilege cards: race, gender, economic class, sexual orientation, and ability. Each player gets a card and takes turns drawing privilege cards from a stack. If you get a card that matches your own identity, you mark it off on your card. The first player to mark off all five types of privilege on their card is the winner!

There was much excitement in the air as players battled it out to be the first to win Privilege Bingo. Some were more competitive than others, but in the end everyone had a great time. Terrence and Astrid would like to thank everyone who came out and supported their event. They are already planning the next game, which will be even bigger and better!
